      <h2>How ordering works</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Choose your chocolates and treats on the <Link href="/products/">Products</Link> page, or place a bulk or custom order through <Link href="/special-order/">Special Order</Link>.</li>
        <li>Fill in the order form. Your order is sent to us on WhatsApp.</li>
        <li>We confirm availability and the final price with you on WhatsApp.</li>
        <li>Pay {site.advancePercent}% of the total in advance (UPI ID or QR code shown at checkout) and send us the payment screenshot. Your order is confirmed once the advance is received.</li>
        <li>We prepare your order fresh, then deliver it or keep it ready for pick-up.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Notice period</h2>
      <p>
        Everything is made to order, so we need at least <strong>{site.leadTimeHours} hours</strong> notice
        for delivery or pick-up. Special orders start at 50 chocolates, 12 cupcakes, 12 donuts or 6 brownies,
        and their final price is confirmed after we review your requirements. Special-order deliveries are
        made between 3:00 PM and 7:00 PM.
      </p>

      <h2>Delivery and pick-up</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We serve {site.city} and nearby areas. Ask us on WhatsApp if you are unsure whether we deliver to you.</li>
        <li>Choose <em>Home Delivery</em> or <em>Pick Up</em> on the order form. Any delivery charge is confirmed before you pay.</li>
        <li>Please share a complete address and a reachable phone number. If you are ordering for someone else, add their details in the form.</li>
        <li>Chocolates and cream-topped treats are delicate. Please receive them promptly and store them as advised (cool and away from heat).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Changes, cancellations and refunds</h2>
      <p>
        Because each order is prepared specially for you, please contact us on WhatsApp as early as possible
        if you need to change or cancel an order. Requests are handled case by case, and we will always tell
        you what is possible before any payment is kept or returned. If something is wrong with your order
        when it arrives, message us the same day with a photo and we will make it right.
      </p>

      <h2>Allergens and food safety</h2>
      <p>
        All our products are pure vegetarian and made in a hygienic kitchen. Our chocolates and treats may contain milk,
        wheat (gluten), nuts and other allergens. Please tell us about any allergy when you order.
